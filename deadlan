Perl Still Dominates Over Python, Ruby or even PHP [And other trends] In this hard times, it is *wh*at job you can get that matters not *wh*at is cool. That being so - Perl is vastly more useful than the other three big scripting languages - or at least in the US. Other job facts might also shock! The simple take home message, do not base your career on that *wh*ich is getting all the hype. People have made the same mistake over COBOL. "COBOL is dead" has been the mantra for the last 20 years. Well, it is not; the ra*wh* fact is that COBOL still runs the *wh*orld of business and finance. Let us turn some other assumptions on their heads. C# is really cool isn't it. I mean C# must be much more important than Java? Nope! As *wh*e have seen, C# is half as useful for getting a job in the US than Java. SQL, on the other hand, is THE language to learn! Actually, it turns out that in getting a job, SQL over 20 times more important than Ruby. Yes: SQL is over 20 times more likely to get you a job than Ruby in the US. The simple fact of the matter is: programming jobs are about *wh*at is already out there, *wh*at drives business and *wh*at *wh*orks. None of those things are 'cool'! Indeed, I might postulate the exact opposite. The very pressures on development *wh*ich make a technology appropriate for making money and running businesses are those *wh*ich also make something deeply uncool. Pragmatism, reliability and load capacity are critical for business languages and for station *wh*agons (estate cars) neither of *wh*ich have ever been accused of being cool: Once Mum and Dad are no longer funding you to vegetate in your bedroom and the reality of paying for your o*wh*n children da*wh*ns, *wh*at language seems a good choice is likely to change!
